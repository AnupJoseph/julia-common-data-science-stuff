The idea behind this repo is to have a reference for general everyday data science tasks that you would do using say numpy and pandas in Python or tidyverse in R using the Julia programming language tools.
My plan is to use the [numpy-100](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100) repo as a starting point and then see where to go from there.

The repo is organized like so
* Notebooks - The notebooks have the core code in a question and answer format. Each of the notebooks have a shellscript which allows the notebook to run on Google Colab
* working - Working directory has the `.jl` files for the same thing and will be removed at a later date
