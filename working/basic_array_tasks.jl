# Okay there are a few bits here that we have to address:
# Right of the bat Julia uses 1-based indexing as you probably already know
# The end keyword represents the end of a dimension in Julia, It provides a more explicit way to specify indexes.
# Finally the . operator is used for broadcasting. Julia does not automatically write 0 everywhere if you use just the assignment operator. This can often trip people and instead the . operator provides an explicit broadcasting method

# Ok so this is very much an extremely hacky way to do this but I could find a good way to go about this.
# If you are using this in a context of images processing then Image Filtering has a way described here https://discourse.julialang.org/t/is-there-any-padding-function-available-to-pad-a-matrix-or-array/8521/3
# PaddedViews.jl might be an option too if you are using this a lot
